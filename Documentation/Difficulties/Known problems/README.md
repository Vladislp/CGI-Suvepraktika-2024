## Known Problems

This section outlines the known problems or issues in the current version of the project. Please refer to this list for information on ongoing challenges and areas that need attention.

### Problem 1: [Two windows when choosing the seat]

- **Symptoms:**
  - When customer is desided with desired film, he/she should see only information about the movie they choose and seating plan. In the end you can see both, movie list and seat planner.

- **Impact:**
  - The problem is, that at first you don't know if you chose or what is going on. Customer experience is declining and you need to move mouse up to see it.

- **Steps to Reproduce:**
  - Run front-end and back-end
  - Press "Vaata l√§hemalt" on any movie option
  - Press "Vaata kohad"
  - You will see still movie selection, but move with roller higher on the page, where you will see similar to this.
  
- **Potential Solutions:**
  - One workaround is you have to refresh the page and you will see only seat planner with movie information. Possible problem, is that i could not send data dynamicaly about the movie. I saved everything inside **localstorage** which makes it worse, but it's a working solution.
