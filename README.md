## Movie and Seat Recommendation Web Application

This web application is designed to help cinema-goers find suitable movies based on their preferences and recoomend optimal seats within the cinema hall. Users can apply various filters to refine their movie choices, taking into account their viewing history, preferred genres, and timing preferences. The application also provides seat recommendations within the cinema hall for the selected movie, considering factors such as the user's preferred seating position.
## Features

### Movie Recommendations
* Users can apply filters such as genre, viewing history, and time preferences to receive personalized movie recommendations.

### Seat Recommendations
* Upon selecting a movie, the application suggests optimal seat(s) within the cinema hall.
* The seat recommendations take into account general preferences, such as sitting in the middle of the screen, not too close or too far.

### Filters

* **Genre Filters**: Choose specific genres or a mix of genres based on personal preferences.
* **Viewing History**: Consider the user's past movie choices to recommend films with similar characteristics.

### Seat Recommendation Guidelines
